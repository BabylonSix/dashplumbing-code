		Pete Bruyako is a licensed Master Plumber with more than 20 years of experience in residential and commercial plumbing. He has worked on everything from residential new builds and remodels to large scale commercial installations such as hospitals. Pete's philosophy is to put people first in doing fair business. Pete began his plumbing career in Sacramento, California. He relocated to central Ohio in 2011 to join in a plumbing business, AB Plumbing and Rooter, LLC, with his brother. Pete's brother was tragically taken in a motorcycle accident, and Pete chose to move forward and make a fresh start by opening a plumbing division with an existing company, Dash Construction. Pete had worked with Dash on projects prior to his brother's passing, and believes the ethics and values of Dash Construction align with his own. You can see Pete out and about with his loyal confidant and adviser, Kiki, a friendly female Doberman, who is a local celebrity in her own right.
